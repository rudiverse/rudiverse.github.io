This is a little story about some of those I met along the way.  
Brothers, a boxer, the boss.  
Even someone from a pack of cards ...

---

Let's start with **Yesterday**  
**When I was young**  
Roaming in **My Hometown**  

Thinking about my **Brothers in Arms**  
**All Along the Watchtower**  
I cherish the **Sound of Silence**  

Looking back ...  
**Objects in the rear view mirror**  
-> *May appear closer than they are*

How is it, living **Like a Rolling Stone**  
*If you got nothing*  
*You got nothing to lose*

I **Don't** want to **Pay the Ferryman**  
Even when *I'm one, I'm two, I'm three, I'm four*  
*I'm* **500 Miles** *away from home*

Neither in summer, nor in a cold **November Rain**  
Do I want to **Get Stuck Inside of Mobile**  
-> **With that Memphis Blues Again**

Quoting *Paul Simon and Joan Baez*:

> *I am older than I once was*  
*And younger than I'll be*  
*But that's not unusual*

> *Nor is it strange*  
*After changes upon changes*  
*We are more or less the same*

*Susan* says:
> It's okay to **Feel the Fear**  
As long as you **Do It Anyway**

*Nordic Jo* asks:
> **Who Am I**  
**Where Do I Come From**

> *A* **Joker** *is a little fool who is different from everyone else.*  
*He's not a club, diamond, heart, or spade.*  
*He's not an eight or a nine, a king or a jack.*  
*He is an outsider.*  
*He is placed in the same pack as the other cards, but he doesn't belong there.*

**Let It Be**  
**Come As You Are**  
And **Nothing Else Matters**  

**This is the end**  
-> *My only friend, the end ...*

---

**I'm only human**, *after all*  
*Don't put the blame on me*

*Just do as I say*  
*Don't do as I do*

Sure, I could have talked more  
If only I knew **How to Make Gravy**
