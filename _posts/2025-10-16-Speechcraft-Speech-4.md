This is a story about brothers, a boxer, the boss ... and some more

Being in **My Hometown**  
Thinking about **Yesterday**  
**When I was young**

*I was so much older then*  
*When I was young*

What's life **Like a Rolling Stone**  
*If you got nothing*  
*You got nothing to lose*

I cherish the **Sounds of Silence**  
Be it in **My Hometown**  
Or when *I am 1, I am 2, I am 3, I am 4, I am* **500 miles** *away from home*

When driving down memory lane  
**Objects in the rear view mirror**  
-> *May appear closer than they are*

Thinking about my **Brothers in Arms**  
Moving **All Along the Watchtower**  
**Don't think twice, it's alright**

Do I want to go on a **Yellow Submarine**  
Maybe in a **November Rain**  
I certainly **Don't** want to **Pay the Ferryman**

I don'know **How to Make Gravy**  
I don't see a **Stairway to Heaven**  
I just don't want to **Get Stuck Inside of Mobile**  
-> **With that Memphis Blues Again**

*Susan* says it's okay to **Feel the Fear**  
-> As long as you **Do It Anyway**

*Nordic Jo* asks  
**Who Am I**  
-> **Where Do I Come From**

*Paul and Joan* say  

*"I am older than I once was*  
*And younger than I'll be*  
*But that's not unusual*

*"Nor is it strange*  
*After changes upon changes*  
*We are more or less the same"*

When **Nothing Else Matters**  
**Let It Be**

**This is the end**  
-> *My only friend, the end ...*
