Thinking about **Yesterday**  
**When I was young**  
In **My Hometown**  

Thinking about my **Brothers in Arms**  
Moving **All Along the Watchtower**  
I cherish the **Sound of Silence**  

Looking back,  
**Objects in the rear view mirror**  
-> *May appear closer than they are*

How is it, living **Like a Rolling Stone**  
*If you got nothing*  
*You got nothing to lose*

I **Don't** want to **Pay the Ferryman**  
Even when *I'm one, I'm two, I'm three, I'm four*  
*I'm* **500 Miles** *away from home*

Neither in summer, nor in a **November Rain**  
Do I want to **Get Stuck Inside of Mobile**  
-> **With that Memphis Blues Again**


*Paul and Joan* say  

*"I am older than I once was*  
*And younger than I'll be*  
*But that's not unusual*

*"Nor is it strange*  
*After changes upon changes*  
*We are more or less the same"*

*Susan* says it's okay to **Feel the Fear**  
-> As long as you **Do It Anyway**

*Nordic Jo* asks  
**Who Am I**  
-> **Where Do I Come From**

*A* **Joker** *is a little fool who is different from everyone else.*  
*He's not a club, diamond, heart, or spade.*  
*He's not an eight or a nine. He is an outsider.*  
*He is placed in the same pack as the other cards, but he doesn't belong there.*

**Let It Be**  
**Come As You Are**  
And **Nothing Else Matters**  

**This is the end**  
-> *My only friend, the end ...*

I'm only human, don't put the blame on me

Being in **My Hometown**  
Thinking about **Yesterday**  
*When all my troubles seemed so far away*

**When I was young**  
*I was so much older then*  
*When I was young*

How's living **Like a Rolling Stone**  
*If you got nothing*  
*You got nothing to lose*

I cherish the **Sound of Silence**  
Be it in **My Hometown**  
Or when *I am 1, I am 2, I am 3, I am 4, I am* **500 miles** *away from home*

Driving down memory lane  
**Objects in the rear view mirror**  
-> *May appear closer than they are*

Thinking about my **Brothers in Arms**  
Moving **All Along the Watchtower**  
**Don't think twice, it's alright**

Do I want to go on a **Yellow Submarine**  
Maybe in a **November Rain**  
I certainly **Don't** want to **Pay the Ferryman**

I don'know **How to Make Gravy**  
I can't find a **Stairway to Heaven**  
I just don't want to **Get Stuck Inside of Mobile**  
-> **With that Memphis Blues Again**

*Paul and Joan* say  

*"I am older than I once was*  
*And younger than I'll be*  
*But that's not unusual*

*"Nor is it strange*  
*After changes upon changes*  
*We are more or less the same"*

*Susan* says it's okay to **Feel the Fear**  
-> As long as you **Do It Anyway**

*Nordic Jo* asks  
**Who Am I**  
-> **Where Do I Come From**

*A* **Joker** *is a little fool who is different from everyone else.*  
*He's not a club, diamond, heart, or spade.*  
*He's not an eight or a nine. He is an outsider.*  
*He is placed in the same pack as the other cards, but he doesn't belong there.*
