Yesterday, we had a public holiday in New Zealand, Waitangi Day (observed, because the real Waitangi Day 6 Feb was on the weekend). That made it a long weekend, nice. I usually go on a little trail run on the Skyline Walkway once per weekend, and I hadn't done it that weekend. So, last chance now before work starts again the next day.

I started on top of Montgomery Ave, Karori, Wellington, and turned right, intending to run up to Johnston Hill, and back again. After the first climb, going downhill, I came across another runner making his way up. He warned me about a couple of cows on the trail. I decided to carry on. Soon, I saw only one cow, a big black monster though. She gave me enough room to pass her at her bottom side. At the gate/cattle grid, the downhill run changed uphill again. Not too far up, I felt dizzy all of a sudden. That never happened to me before on a run. I stopped, and I almost felt like fainting. Squatting down, and putting one hand on higher ground, helped a bit. I may have stayed like that for a minute, then decided to walk back home. That walk was alright, but I didn't dare to start running again. 

At home, I sat down and had a glass of water. After going to the toilet, I thought it may be a bit risky to have a shower straight away, in case the fainting feeling comes back. I felt a bit funny, so I decided to go to bed for a rest.

I may have been sleeping for an hour or so. When I awoke, the ceiling and the room were spinning around me. I moved my head, and I felt like vomiting. Calling my wife, she and our son assisted me to "walk" to the toilet. My sense of balance was gone completely. After that, I vomited several times. Lying down in bed, with my eyes closed, helped a bit. I slept again. Waking up next time, the same symptoms were still there, just as heavy as before. What could have happened to me? Was some form of cancer or brain tumour suddenly looking for attention? I had stomach bugs before, which that kind of vomiting reminded me of. Or was it food poisoning? Was this the kind of feeling Alexei Navalny got when he was poisoned? Or did a stress-related event trigger a nervous breakdown? I asked my wife to call Healthline, just in case.

There is always a first assessment by the Healthline operator, followed by a phone call from a nurse. Their priority seemed to be making sure I wasn't suffering a heart attack or a stroke. The nurse then decided I should see a doctor within 6 hours. Not being able to sit upright, I couldn't go in a car, so she arranged an ambulance. A non-urgent one though, no siren or blue light. And that took time, probably a couple of hours. We got called half-hourly though, checking in my condition hadn't changed. After the paramedics arrived, they did some exams, determining the urgency, and also making sure we weren't dealing with heart attack or stroke. Heart function and blood pressure looked fine. The paramedics were two really warm-hearted females.

My wife doesn't drive past Karori, so we asked if she and our son could get on the ambulance. My wife could sit with me, and our son got the first time experience of being on the front passenger seat of an ambulance. When I asked him the next day if that was at least a little bit of fun during that stressful and scary time, he said he was actually a bit concerned ... about pushing the wrong button and possibly setting off the siren.

Some joyride over Karori West speedbumps and down to Newtown later, I was pushed into Wellington hospital's emergency department on the ambulance stretcher. One paramedic reported my condition to emergency room staff, and that staff asked us the compulsory covid related questions. Then, they pushed my stretcher towards an empty bed on the emergency room floor. They had to wait a bit though, because another patient had just been flown in by helicopter, after a motorbike accident, blocking the way. I couldn't see him, but my wife recognised him as our dear friend Ian. Was this another one of those typical New Zealand coincidences? I couldn't really be happy that Ian was here as well, because he was obviously not in a good condition. Later at night I found out that he had a badly fractured leg.

I rolled over to a bed on the emergency floor, and that movement brought back the dizziness. It hadn't been too bad on the ambulance anymore. I stayed in a flat position on the bed for another couple of hours, hoping there wouldn't be any Dr Bean sneaking around.

When a nurse finally saw me, I dared to sit half upright, and it wasn't too bad anymore. It may have been around 7pm by then. The last time I had eaten anything was breakfast around 9am, before my run. The nurse asked if I wanted to have a sandwich, or maybe an ice-block. I settled for the ice-block, which was a good refreshment at that time. After some more waiting, my bed got pushed in a cabin, and soon after a nurse came, doing some more checks. At that time I finally accepted a sandwich, and my wife brought me some nice herbal tea. Then, waiting. And, waiting. Wife and son finally left by taxi, around 8:30pm. Our son had his first real scheduled school day in his college the next day. Before they left, I got my son's support walking to the toilet, in case I would get dizzy again. But I could walk freely, albeit slowly. At that point, I could finally also walk over to Ian, who happened to be on the emergency floor again. Amazing, in how good spirits he was, considering his injury.

I waited again, by myself now. For hours. Time to exchange some texts with Ian. I also notified my employer that I wouldn't come to work the next day, and falsely hinted at my condition possibly being vortex - instead of vertigo. Yes, we had been watching both Mr Bean and Johnny English a lot, blame them. The nurse finally came again, some checks, and telling me I should finally be seen by a doctor very soon. I asked for another sandwich, and felt safe enough now to sit at the edge of my bed, and eat and drink some of the goodies my wife had prepared for me with much love.

By the time the doctor arrived, spinning feeling and nausea had gone. Some dizziness had remained though, and I was still a bit wobbly on my feet. The doctor listened carefully to my story, asked some specific questions, and did some more assessments. He was sure it was peripheral (ears) and not central (which could point to a stroke). Vertigo, he explained, can be caused by a viral infection, or by a misalignment of ear crystals. The sudden onset and relatively quick recovery point strongly to a misalignment of ear crystals, called BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). This can happen to anyone, and is not a matter of age. I should not need further treatment. He believed my crystals had realigned themselves again. There are cases where a doctor or physiotherapist need to assist with alignment though.

To be really sure there wasn't anything else of concern, the doctor ordered a blood test. That got done by a nurse again, and I had to wait a bit for the result. That came back alright, so I was discharged, just before midnight, after arriving at the hospital more than 6 hours earlier, and about 13 hours after the first symptoms. Lucky to take the taxi home, with the reassurance I am not seriously sick. A couple of days of resting, drinking lots of liquid, and watching out, then I should be fine again. And even allowed to go for a run again next weekend. Fingers crossed, recovery goes as planned.

So, the doctor said, BPPV can happen to anyone, at any age. They don't know of anything which could cause it. I do want to read up on it though, especially since I believe there were a few things during the last days which I consider not too healthy. I returned to the office at work on the Thursday prior, after 2.5 days of annual leave and half a day working from home. Playing the catch-up game, probably juggling a bit too many things at once, and not happy about everything, I felt a bit stressed. Having another coffee at lunch time (after the normal couple of morning ones) had enabled me perfectly to stay awake at night for a bit too long, to contemplate on work items. That lack of sleep didn't make the Friday at work any easier. On Thursday, there was also an issue with the aircon, blowing on me in a very cold way for many hours. I felt a bit run-down on Saturday, and didn't do too much. Sunday, I still didn't feel fully right in the morning, but that settled, and I had a good day.

Or, hmm, could it have been that big black monster I ran past on the trail yesterday? Maybe the cow farted on me, and caused all this dizziness?

I am feeling very lucky to have the support of my wife and my son. Thank you so much! 
And of course also a big thanks to all the medical staff helping me yesterday, our most essential workers at all times.

[Update - 11 Feb] Another couple of days later, after being at work in the office again today, I noticed how consciously I have been walking now. I appreciate even more than before that our species is able to walk upright. What an amazing achievement of evolution.
