What was I doing when it happened?

It happened 3 times in my lifetime  
At very different periods in my life  
What was I doing when it happened?

---

I was a pre-schooler in 1974  
Well looked after by my parents  
An obedient child unter my mum's protection  

I collected stickers for my album of that big event  
Petrol stations gave them away for "free"  
I was happy my local fellas won

They won the football world cup at home, in Germany  
The most important players were Bavarians anyway  
Even more reason to be proud

1990 was the second time in my life when it happened  
Germany became football world champions again  
The first time as a unified Germany  

Not that many Bavarian players anymore  
Still, the coach was Bavarian  
Lifting the trophy for the second time, after 1974

I was a tertiary student at that time  
Still devoted to football  
But also open-minded about what's going on in the world

In 2002 ... it didn't happen  
Germany didn't win the world cup  
Beaten by Brazil in the final

But it was the most remarkable world cup experience I had  
Gathering in the Far North of New Zealand  
Kahoe Farms Hostel, run by Stefano, a football mad Italian

There were several of us staying for most of the world cup  
English, Irish, Belgians, Danish, Israelis, Japanese ... and me  
Watching as many games as possible in the cold garage

Even TVNZ came by  
They heard of that odd international crowd we were  
You may have seen me with a mohican on the news that time

Germany played badly, didn't deserve to make it to the final  
Odd enough, they actually would have deserved to win the final  
But Ollie Kahn, the goalkeeper who actually got us into the final in the first place  
Made a major mistake in that final

I promised a third time when it happened  
The real thing, Germany winning the world cup again  
2014 that was

Hold on, 2014, wasn't there another major event happening?  
Oh yes, I joined PartsTrader, for the first time  
A few years after moving my family to Wellington

At PTNZ, our PO Joe was a football mad English guy  
I watched semifinal and final with him in a pub  

Brazil faced their second worst disaster, a 7-1 defeat at home by Germany  
Germany then prevented their worst disaster happening  
Which would have been Argentina winning the world cup on Brazilian soil

That was the last time it happened ... so far

So, what was I doing when it happened?

I was the obedient child in a Bavarian Forest village  
I grew more open-minded during studies in my hometown  
I was a free roamer preparing my move to New Zealand  
I looked after my family in Wellington

That's what I was doing when it happened
