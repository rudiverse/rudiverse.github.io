It is raining  
That makes me cry  
Does it rain when you cry

I will never forget you  
Seventeen and a half years of deep love  
Once again, I wasn't there

I want to cry  
I want to be alone  
Alone with you

I was hoping to see you again  
You could not wait any longer  
I was not even there with my thoughts

My body is shaking  
I am happy about that  
Do you remember me

I am the one who has to leave  
The one who cannot stay forever  
Now you had to leave

I am the one who goes out  
The one who loves to return  
There is no return without a good-bye

When will we meet again  
I am still a human  
Restricted to a few senses

What do you feel at this very moment  
Do you feel the cold earth  
Or can you feel me

Were you happy about our grief  
Or did our pain hurt you  
Did you understand my sister

Please forgive me  
Forgive me for not having been there  
Forgive me for having left you so often

Look at my tears  
They are dedicated to you  
And all the loved ones who have gone before

Coming home will become very different  
No greeting from you  
Or can I get one

The place is cold without you  
It might freeze in summer-time  
My tears will be fresh and warm

Life hurts  
Life is joy  
Life is love

Love is everything
